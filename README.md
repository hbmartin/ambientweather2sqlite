# AmbientWeather to SQLite

A project to record minute-by-minute weather observations from an AmbientWeather station over the local network - no API needed!

## Installation

* macOS: `brew install pipx && pipx install ambientweather2sqlite`
* Ubuntu / Debian: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install pipx && pipx install ambientweather2sqlite`
* Fedora: `sudo dnf install pipx && pipx install ambientweather2sqlite`

## Setup

On the first run of `ambientweather2sqlite` you will be asked to provide the station's LiveData URL and the database path.

This config file is saved to your current directory by default but may be stored anywhere.

On subsequent runs, you can pass the file name as a command line argument or it will be automatically detected in your current directory or at `~/.aw2sqlite.toml`
